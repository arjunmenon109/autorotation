# 20th Feb 2023 Meeting With Dr Danish (Found Similar Research Paper) 

At 12:30 PM I met Danish sir and discussed on a discovery I had made. From The University of Maryland a research paper dated October 2007, and named "Design and Testing of an Autorotative Payload Delivery System"
The paper very well relates angle of attack to thrust and RPM. This data would mean that I can basically skip the step of finding an optimum angle of attack for my autorotator, instead, using the given data I can move ahead and design my rotors for optimum drag force.

The same was highlighted in my meeting with Dr Danish, he adviced me to move ahead with the design conditions mentioned in the paper. 
My next step would be to:

Look at the successing papers to this one (citations on google scholar)
Design a blade shape (profile that would be more optimum for an autorotating body
