# Thoughtbank

Here I will post learnings from day-to-day meetings with professors, thoughts & ideas I came up, or general progress. This is a place I can pour my mind without worrying about the literature and other details that might go on the main blog https://hallowed-violin-3bd.notion.site/Autorotation-Targeting-System-28e45035c4364717bd14b821b1056487 (Notion for now, until I find/make an alternative) . Following this will give you an idea of how my thoughts and actions lead to a decision for the project.
