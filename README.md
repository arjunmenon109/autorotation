Autorotation Project Directory

As children, we often made a particular paper “helicopter” which portrays the concept of autorotation rather well. If a piece of A4 paper is folded in the right way, a paper clip is added at the end, and this contraption is dropped from a height we can observe the ‘helicopter’ spin, not only slowing its descent but also keeping it center due to the opposing forces. This phenomenon is also seen in nature. Some trees use this technique to disperse their seeds far away from the tree. 
The main idea is to maneuver accurately, stabilize, and/or slow down and safely land a falling object on a predetermined landing location. Can be used as an alternative to the conventional thrust vector control system. Using the autorotation concept, we should be able to maneuver, stabilize, and slow down a falling object from a said altitude. 

This is the project directory, with all nesassary information for the project. Along with research, CAD Models, files, and more. The main idea of this place is to keep my work more organised, so that others can easily understand and move my research forward.

Here I will be posting updates, almost like a book.
