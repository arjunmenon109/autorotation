FIRST PROTOTYPE DATA

Before we make a calculated cad model of the autorotating prototype we need to first calculate basic values for both Wm and Area (Cd) in order to get the design conditions

Material Details:

PLA Plastic
Wm = 30g
Mass Model for Radius = Mass Almost Doubles with incresing radius
